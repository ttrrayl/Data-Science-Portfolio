## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Regional Super App Analysis Understanding Consumption Patterns And Product Preferences In Several Provinces Of Indonesia
**Code:** [`Full Code`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V1HIHU9Z_ObeA4Yy9ZLqD12n5u2qfT7y?usp=sharing)

**Goal:** Identifying trends and usage patterns of their e-commerce application based on data.

**Description:** The Super App company faces challenges in identifying and understanding the trends and usage patterns of their application, which vary across provinces. These variations arise due to each province's unique demographic and economic characteristics, influencing users' preferences and needs for the products offered.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization, machince learning.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Triple Exponential Smoothing, K-Means.

**Results:** Based on the insights obtained, the actions the company can take include developing products specifically for women, exploring the market in Central Papua, implementing more aggressive discount strategies, and launching new user campaigns. Meanwhile, forecasting results indicate a decline in gross value in Central Java and Gorontalo, as well as fluctuations in Central Papua. Therefore, appropriate marketing strategies are needed for these regions.


### Public Sentiment Analysis Towards the Indonesian National Police Using the SVM Algorithm
**Code:** 
1. [`Crawling and Preprocessing`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nRmiailP5lrDp9JQs_xh_-GL6lvtVTY-?usp=sharing).
2. [`Modelling and Evaluation`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WG5UQyrCVQbGW8h0U-fwlBNjL-iYizqe?usp=sharing).

**Goal:** Understanding how the public perceives or expresses their opinions about Polri (the Indonesian National Police) using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

**Description:** Twitter is one of the social media platforms widely used for expressing opinions and discussing various phenomena. These activities generate a massive amount of text data. However, this abundance of text data does not inherently provide any conclusions. If managed properly, such text data can offer valuable information to assist individuals or organizations in making decisions. This study aims to analyze public sentiment towards the Indonesian National Police (Polri). The methods employed in this research include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and SVM (Support Vector Machine).

**Skills:** crawling data, data cleaning, TF-IDF, machince learning, data evaluation.

**Technology:** Python, TF-IDF, SVM.

**Results:** Classification of public opinion data about Polri (the Indonesian National Police) in Indonesian based on sentiment can be performed using the SVM algorithm. The amount of training data used significantly impacts the system's performance. This is evidenced by the results, which show an accuracy score of 0.71, a precision score of 0.82, a recall score of 0.71, and an F1-score of 0.72. Additionally, the prediction results for the sentences align with the expected outcomes.
